# quasar-template-meteor
Quasar Starter Kit for Meteor

(Updated 30th April 2020).

#### Quasar 1.9.6

#### Meteor 1.10.2

This is a resource which will show how to install Quasar inside the Meteor framework, with Vue2 also installed.

With the arrival of Meteor 1.8.2 you can now simply install quasar from npm
```
meteor npm install quasar
```


#### Installation of this example code

**clone this repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-meteor.git
```

**cd into the 'template' folder:**
```
cd quasar-template-meteor/template
```

**Install from npm**

```
meteor npm install
```


**Create a link to the quasar-extras .woff files in the /public directory**
This makes the material-icons stuff appear
```
ln -s ../node_modules/@quasar/extras/material-icons/web-font public

```

There is a good explanation on StackOverflow of why there is a problem with the .woff files
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34133808/webpack-ots-parsing-error-loading-fonts

(If you are doing this on *Windows* the link command is:
```
mklink /D "public\web-font" "..\node_modules\@quasar\extras\material-icons\web-font"
```
 - thanks to Noboxulus)


**run meteor (still inside the template folder)**

```
meteor
```

It should then say:
App running at: http://localhost:3000/

Point your desktop browser to that address.

Then if you open Chrome or Firefox dev tools and click on the mobile phone icon you should see this:

Please refer to guide.meteor.com/mobile.html for how to launch mobile apps on IOS and Android.

Meteor simplifies some of the difficulties of running your app on IOS for development 
(install Xcode, plug your phone into the USB port and call 'meteor run ios-device'), however
registering yourself as an Apple developer and working out how to register your app is a fairly frustrating experience. 

This project uses the Akryum projects to simplify Meteor working with vuejs and quasar-framework.
The most useful page to consult is:
https://github.com/meteor-vue/vue-meteor-tracker

This is the main page for all the Meteor/Vuejs projects:

#### Note:
The 'template' folder is a necessary part of the quasar framework.
However all meteor commands should only be run once you have moved inside the 'template' folder.
This extra 'template' folder is there because quasar-framework requires it. 
However, Quasar-framework uses Webpack for its builds, but Meteor has its own build system.
This means that it is unlikely that you will be able to use *quasar cli*, because it all leads up to a quasar build using webpack.

To use Meteor, just cd into the 'template' folder and run all your usual meteor commands from there.
